## Hi there, I'm Beth ðŸ‘‹

After spending 12 years with my family's company, I am pursuing a career change. Through my various roles over the past 12 years, I have done data analysis and visualizations informally. Since that was always my favorite part of any job I had, I want to pursue Data Analytics full time. I love how using SQL or R to pull the desired information out of a database is like a puzzle to solve. Then creating visualizations and communicating my findings is always exciting because I get to share my brainpower with others to help them understand my findings. 

## Skills I've gained through job experience: 
- Data-driven decision making - strategy, problem solving, organization
- Excel Analysis
- Communication of Data Analysis - data visualization, presenting, written explanation of analysis

## Completed education for SQL and R skills
- Google Data Analytics Certificate
- Case studies (https://github.com/BC734/Bellabeat_Case_Study)
- SQL problem sets (https://github.com/BC734/SQL)

## Ongoing education for SQL skills
- Break Into Tech Certificate Course
- Roadmap.sh SQL Roadmap
-   [![roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/card/tall/66954d89298168c1091f0b1d?variant=dark&roadmaps=sql)](https://roadmap.sh)

My intention in the next month is to complete the Break Into Tech Certificate course, continue to complete items on the roadmap.sh guide, and complete at least one more case study - this time using SQL and Tableau to demonstrate those skills.
